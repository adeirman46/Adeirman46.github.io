            <p>
                This project is my final Electrical Engineering bachelor thesis, which received the <strong>Best Research</strong> award. It is a Level 2 Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) based on SAE standards, designed to be uniquely compatible with older cars featuring semi-drive-by-wire systems. The core innovation is its plug-and-play nature, allowing modern autonomous features to be retrofitted into vehicles that typically do not support them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system was successfully tested by <strong>109 people</strong> during a three-day public exhibition and was also personally tested by the President of Software from Toyota, Japan. This project was proudly funded by LPDP and Riset.AI Ltd.
